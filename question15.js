//15. Explain your knowledge of - statelessness, http, REST, spa and classical applications

// statelessness is a property of REST apis that dictates that each request should be self-suffiecent and not rely on any previous calls.
// this makes them more effecient

/*
the hypertext transfer protocol is the way that different devices connected to the same http network communicate
*/

/*
Representational State Tranfer APIs are apis that follow REST standards. It is a way to design apis around the http framework to leverage http verbs and ensure efficiency by maintaining statelessness
In doing so, it remains scalable, low latency, and follows legacy standards
*/

/*
Single page applications are web apps that load a single page and then update it via JS apis. this speeds up performance because it does not require loading an entirely new page everytime an action is performed
*/

/*
classical applications would have several pages of UI information wired to background logic. this was cumbersome since every page would need to be loaded fresh and many of the background logics may not be compatable or needed installation
